The security of women is a critical issue faced by society.
Crimes against women such as eve teasing, sexual assaults, domestic violence are increasing in number day by day.
When it comes to security concerns, a smart phone can be one the easiest way of gaining help.
This project strives to create an android app which can help to protect women in any situation she might face in her day-to-day life.
We have created a simple Android application which comprises various safety measures which can be used by women with a few clicks on the screen, to get quick and easy access to help or to avoid and escape a harmful situation.
It uses GPS location tracking to provide a simple and fast way for the registered contacts to know that the user is in trouble and for them to reach the user easily.
It also provides safety features such as a image capturing which can help a woman or the police for identification or situational evidence , a siren to alert the public of any misbehavior,
emergency helpline numbers which can be used to directly connect via call to emergency services according to the situation faced by women for their safety.
